Recursion vs Iterative Programming 

A Fibonacci series of numbers is characterized as the following: 0 1 1 2 3, where the sum of the
previous two numbers equal the current number.

With that in mind implement a recursive function called fiboSeriesRec that will produce the
Fibonacci series of numbers output up to a predefined n (input by the user). This means that the
user will first enter the nth Fibonacci series number and your program will have to calculate the
number up until the nth value. 

Utilizing a timing library, time the run time to calculate and display the Fibonacci series
to the user define nth number. Test a variety of inputs when utilizing a recursive method, and test
a variety of different inputs when utilizing an iterative method of generating a Fibonacci series.

Five test were ran with n=10, n=20, n=30, n=40 and n=50.
